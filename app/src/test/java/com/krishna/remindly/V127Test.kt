/**
 * v1.27 regression coverage.
 *  - item 1 removed the delete-in-Done apparatus and the four `*DeleteInDone` settings fields;
 *    these confirm settings still round-trip cleanly without them, and that a settings blob
 *    which still carried those keys (old installs) would heal/migrate without error.
 *  - item 2 is a pure UI conversion (AlertDialog -> ModalBottomSheet) with no new logic, so its
 *    verification is device-checklist only.
 * (The "no two same-titled settings sections" guard is a compile-time/code-review property —
 *  the duplicate section was physically removed — not a JVM-testable assertion.)
